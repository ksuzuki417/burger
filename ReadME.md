  ## Description
  As a Hamburger restaurant owner, I wanted to create an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the bruger on the left side and waiting to be devoured. Once "Devour it" button is clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM and designed using MVC pattern. Unfortunately, the app cannot loaded onto a browser.
